# Faculty Calendar Scheduler

Faculty Calendar Scheduler
Faculty Calendar Scheduler is a web application designed to provide an easy and convenient way for faculties and Head of Department (HOD) to coordinate their schedules and manage their academic activities efficiently. This repository contains the source code for the Faculty Calendar Scheduler project.

## Introduction
In academic institutions, managing and organizing faculty schedules can be a challenging task. Coordinating periods, handling leaves, and ensuring smooth functioning of classes require effective communication and coordination among faculties. The Faculty Calendar Scheduler aims to streamline these processes by offering a centralized platform for faculty members and the HOD to manage their schedules.

## Key Features
* Individual Timetables: All faculties have access to their own personalized timetables for the academic year. This feature enables faculties to easily plan and organize their teaching schedules.

* HOD Access: The HOD can view the timetables of all faculties. This allows the HOD to monitor and manage the overall scheduling and allocation of resources effectively.

* Leave and Time-off Management: Faculties can apply for leave or time-off directly through the web application. This information is then communicated to other faculties, enabling them to adjust their schedules accordingly. The leave application is sent to the HOD for approval.

* Approval Workflow: The HOD has the authority to approve or reject faculty leave applications. This ensures a streamlined process for managing leaves, maintaining adequate teaching coverage, and avoiding scheduling conflicts.

* Meeting Scheduling: The HOD can schedule meetings for all faculties. Once a meeting is scheduled, it automatically reflects in the calendars of all faculties. This feature enhances communication and coordination among the faculty members and facilitates the organization of important discussions and collaborations.
